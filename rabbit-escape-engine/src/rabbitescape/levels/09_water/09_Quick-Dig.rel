:hint.1=Get to the exit before your rabbits drown.
:hint.2=Try digging in different places. Some solutions just involve being quick, and others involve releasing some water to buy time.
:hint.3=Immediately dig through the slope to the right of the entrance, then dig through the flat block just before the slope up to the right.  Simple, right?
